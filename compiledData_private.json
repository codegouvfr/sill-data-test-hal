In its current state, the CROC system requires pre-annotated mentions. We detail the features that we chose to be used by the learning algorithms, and we present a set of experiments with these features. The scores we obtain are close to those of state-of-the-art systems for written English. Then we give future works on the design of an end-to-end system for oral and written French.",
